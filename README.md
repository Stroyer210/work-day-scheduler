## Description  :bookmark_tabs:

This was an amazing project for me because we had to create everything from scratch, so I could implement HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledges. As soon as I saw what this project was I got really excited because when I was in college, I used to take quizes like these so I know this looks like a real/practical project.  The functionality of the application is to create a quiz; so it gives you a couple of questions with its answers but also there is a timer going on; after either the timer is gone or you asnwered the questions, it will ask you for your initials and it will store your score in the High Score Chart. Finally, one of the things that I learned what to create a lot of elements in the JavaScript plus giving them attribute, classes, etc. So it is another way to code instead of just using HTML and CSS.

## Installation :computer:

You are able to use the work day scheduler and see my code ahead:

 1. If you want to try the actual application, you can go to this URL: https://stroyer210.github.io/coding-quiz/
 2. If you want to see my code, you have my repository's folder on top, plus all the documents, such HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Usage :bar_chart:
If you are unable to open the URL, I attached a screenshot of it below:

After you open the application, you will have to click the button that says "Generate Password", and then it is gonna ask you how long you want your password, then it is gonna ask you if you want uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols and finally it is gonna generate a random password with the group of characters that you asked for.
