## Description  :bookmark_tabs:

This project was really fascinating because I could practice the usage of the LocalStorage and new tools like jQuery and dayjs. Moreover it was pretty cool to work on a project with those new tools, it really made me look over some notes and pages to fully understand the usage of them and see a simpler way of some code.  The functionality of the application is to create a work scheduler throughout the day, so you can add and delete events and the app will let you know which task you have to do at that specific hour. In brief, I learned how to use third party API's such GoogleFonts, FontAwesome, jQuery, dayjs, etc., and implement them to my projects.

## Installation :computer:

You are able to use the work day scheduler and see my code ahead:

 1. If you want to try the actual application, you can go to this URL: https://stroyer210.github.io/work-day-scheduler/
 2. If you want to see my code, you have my repository's folder on top, plus all the documents, such HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Usage :bar_chart:
If you are unable to open the URL, I attached a screenshot of it below:

    ![This is what it will show after you save an event.](assets/images/work2.png)

After you open the application, you can see the actual date on top, and some blocks underneath that you can add events every hour. After you type the event you have to save it by clicking the disc emoji on the right side of the textarea. Every hour the color of the event will change, letting you know what you have to do at that specific hour.
Additionaly, you can start the day over by clicking the button called "Clear work scheduler" which will delete any events that were already made.
